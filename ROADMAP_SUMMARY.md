## Phase 1: Performance Optimization (Dec 5-15)

### What We'll Discover
| Variant | Expected TPS | Expected VRAM | Purpose |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Q2_K | ~115 TPS | 9 GB | Fastest (low precision) |
| **Q4_K** | **79.97 TPS ✅** | **13 GB** | **Production baseline** |
| Q5_K_M | ~69 TPS | 15 GB | Balanced (high precision) |
| Q6_K | ~52 TPS | 17 GB | Maximum precision |
| Q8_0 | ~58 TPS | 18 GB | Reference ceiling |
| Hybrid | ~89 TPS | 11 GB | Optimized (if feasible) |

### Key Tasks (11 Days)

- **Days 12-14 (Dec 27-29):** Analysis & optimization
- **Day 15 (Dec 30):** Phase 2 completion report

### Critical Metrics
| Metric | Target | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|
| P50 Latency | ≤ 13 ms | ⏳ |

## Critical Success Factors

### Phase 1 Keys
1. **Benchmark all 6 variants** - No shortcuts; complete performance matrix required
2. **Validate hybrid feasibility** - Early determination impacts Phase 2 & 3 scope
3. **Confirm bandwidth bottleneck** - Q8_0 test must show VRAM as limiting factor
4. **Generate publication-quality graphs** - These become marketing/documentation assets

### Phase 2 Keys
1. **Concurrent load stress** - Must achieve P95 < 50ms with 12+ threads
2. **Long-running stability** - 48 hours captures memory leak issues not visible in short tests
3. **Error recovery validation** - Production must handle device failures gracefully
4. **Monitoring infrastructure** - Alerts must catch performance degradation early

### Phase 3 Keys
1. **Definitive metrics only** - No estimates; all numbers from validated testing
2. **SLA achievability** - Guarantees must be conservatively achievable (e.g., 75 TPS not 80)
3. **Operator guide validation** - Non-author must successfully deploy using guide
4. **Decision tree clarity** - Any engineer should pick correct variant without consultation
