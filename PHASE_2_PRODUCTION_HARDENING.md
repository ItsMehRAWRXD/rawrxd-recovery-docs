# Phase 2: Production Hardening & Stability

**Objective:** Validate single-request 80 TPS translates to stable, concurrent production performance.

**Start Date:** December 11, 2025 (after Phase 1)  
**Status:** Planned

---

## 4. Concurrency Load Test

### Goal
Measure P95/P99 latency under **10-15 simultaneous client threads**.

### Why This Matters
- Single-request 80 TPS ≠ Production performance under load
- Vulkan synchronization issues can cause tail latency spikes
- P95 latency is the real SLA metric for production APIs

### Test Configuration

```cpp
// Pseudocode for concurrency test
ThreadPool pool(12 threads);
for (int i = 0; i < 10000; ++i) {
    pool.enqueue([&]() {
        auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
        auto result = inference_engine->generate(256_tokens);  // Q4_K model
        auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
        latencies.push_back(duration_ms(start, end));
    });
}

// Collect latency metrics:
// - Mean, Median, Std Dev
// - P50, P95, P99 latency
// - Throughput (tokens/sec across all threads)
// - GPU utilization (%)
// - VRAM usage (MB)
```

### Expected Metrics

| Metric | Single Thread | 12 Concurrent Threads | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Mean Latency | 12.51 ms | ~15-20 ms | ⏳ Pending |
| P95 Latency | ~13 ms | ~25-35 ms | ⏳ Pending |
| P99 Latency | ~14 ms | ~40-60 ms | ⏳ Pending |
| Aggregate Throughput | 79.97 tok/s | 800-1000 tok/s | ⏳ Pending |
| GPU Util | ~95% | ~98-100% | ⏳ Pending |

### Success Criteria
- [ ] P95 latency < 50ms (acceptable for interactive APIs)
- [ ] P99 latency < 100ms (rare outliers acceptable)
- [ ] Aggregate throughput scales near-linearly (>75% efficiency)
- [ ] No crashes or Vulkan errors under sustained load
- [ ] VRAM stable (no growth spikes)

## 5. Long-Running Stability Test

### Goal
Run GGUF server for **24-48 hours** under light intermittent load.

### Rationale
- Vulkan kernels can have memory leaks over long periods
- Gradual performance degradation indicates fragmentation
- Real-world servers must remain stable across day-night cycles

### Test Protocol

```
Duration: 48 hours continuous
Load Pattern:
  - Generate 50-100 256-token sequences every 30 seconds
  - Interleaved with 5-10 minute idle periods
  - Restart model/engine every 12 hours to reset state

Metrics (sampled every 5 minutes):
  - VRAM allocated (MB)
  - VRAM fragmentation indicator
  - Vulkan device memory pressure
  - Mean inference latency (sliding window)
  - Error count / failures
  - GPU temperature
```

### Expected Outcomes
- VRAM usage remains stable (±50 MB tolerance)
- No gradual latency degradation (mean stays ~12.51 ms)
- Zero unexpected crashes
- Logs show clean shutdown/restart cycles

### Success Criteria
- [ ] 48 hour run completes without crash
- [ ] VRAM delta < 100 MB over full period
- [ ] Mean latency variance < 5%
- [ ] Error logs clean (no Vulkan warnings)
- [ ] Smooth restart transitions documented

- [ ] **Fallback logic** implemented (CPU inference if Vulkan fails)
- [ ] **Documentation** complete (operator runbooks, SLAs)
- [ ] **Load balancing** configured (multiple GPU instances or threads)
